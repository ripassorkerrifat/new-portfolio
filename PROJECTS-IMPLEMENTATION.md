# Projects Implementation - Server-Side Rendering

## Overview
Successfully implemented server-side rendering with URL-based filtering for the projects section.

## Landing Page (/)
- **Rendering**: Static Site Generation (SSG) ○
- **Features**:
  - Shows 6 projects (no filters)
  - Data fetched at build time
  - Simple, clean display
  - "Browse All Projects" button links to `/projects`

## Projects Page (/projects)
- **Rendering**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) ƒ
- **Features**:
  - Filter tabs with URL-based navigation
  - Server-side data fetching based on `category` search param
  - URLs:
    - `/projects` - All projects
    - `/projects?category=front-end` - Frontend projects
    - `/projects?category=backend` - Backend projects
    - `/projects?category=full-stack` - Full Stack projects
    - `/projects?category=others` - Other projects

## Benefits
1. **SEO-Friendly**: Each filter has its own URL
2. **Shareable**: Users can share filtered views
3. **No Client-Side Loading**: Data is ready on page load
4. **Better Performance**: No unnecessary API calls
5. **Browser History**: Back/forward buttons work correctly

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/projects-client.tsx` - Simplified landing page component
2. `/src/app/projects/page.tsx` - Added searchParams support
3. `/src/app/projects/page-client.tsx` - URL-based filtering with router.push()

## Testing
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` - Landing page shows 6 projects
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/projects` - Shows all projects
3. Click filter tabs - URL changes and projects filter server-side
4. Share URL with filter - Works correctly
