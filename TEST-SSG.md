# Testing SSG Implementation

## 🧪 How to Verify SSG is Working

### **1. Build the Project**
```bash
npm run build
```

**What to look for in the output:**
```
Routes:
○ /                             # Static (SSG) ✅
○ /projects                     # Static (SSG) ✅
○ /projects/[id]                # Static with params (SSG) ✅

Legend:
○  (Static)   - automatically rendered as static HTML
```

### **2. Check Generated Files**
```bash
ls -la .next/server/app/
```

Should see:
- `index.html` (landing page)
- `projects.html` (projects page)
- `projects/[id]/` directory with individual project pages

### **3. Test in Production Mode**
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then visit:
- `http://localhost:3000` - Should load instantly
- `http://localhost:3000/projects` - Should load instantly
- `http://localhost:3000/projects/[any-project-id]` - Should load instantly

### **4. Check Network Tab**
Open DevTools → Network:
- First load should show **HTML document** (not just JSON)
- No loading spinners
- Content visible immediately

### **5. View Page Source**
Right-click → "View Page Source":
- Should see actual project HTML content
- NOT empty divs or loading states
- Full SEO metadata in `<head>`

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

1. **Build Output**: Routes marked with ○ (Static)
2. **Fast Load**: Pages load in <500ms
3. **HTML Source**: Real content in page source
4. **No Flash**: No loading spinners on first load
5. **SEO**: Full metadata in HTML

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If pages are not static:**
- Check that components don't have `"use client"` at the top level
- Verify data fetching uses server components
- Ensure no dynamic functions (like `useSearchParams`) in server components

### **If build fails:**
- Check API endpoints are accessible during build
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly
- Check database connection during build

### **If ISR not working:**
- Requires Node.js server (not static export)
- Vercel handles ISR automatically
- Self-hosted needs `npm run start` (not static hosting)

## 📊 Performance Testing

Use Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools):
```bash
# Should see:
Performance: 95-100
SEO: 95-100
Best Practices: 90-100
Accessibility: 90-100
```

Use PageSpeed Insights:
- Enter your URL
- Should see excellent Core Web Vitals
- Green scores across the board
